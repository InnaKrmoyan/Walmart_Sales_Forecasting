# Walmart_Sales_Forecasting

This time series forecasting project aims to predict Walmart's sales using historical sales data and other relevant variables. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model selection and evaluation, and communication of findings.

The aim of our project is to understand the reasons, relationships between the variables, the main driving factors that effect the sales so that we can predict the possible future pattern of the sales of ‘‘Walmart’’. This huge chain of retail stores sell mostly household products and gains profit by that. There are many other businesses like “Walmart” that sell goods for people’s houses but many of them fail to succeed. There are many reasons why that happens such as the company fails to make a good evaluation of the location of their stores as they do not have a good understanding of their customer needs. The rate of sales or shopping may increase on special occasions, which periodically results in less efficient items. To address this, the relationship between customers and retailers is examined, and any necessary adjustments are made in order to increase the profit.
All in all, we want to understand our data make any necessary changes to make good visualizations that will show us the fluctuations of the sales (which is our main variable) and the relationship between it and the remaining variables.
